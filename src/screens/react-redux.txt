Redux Basics: (Complex to understand but easy to use if we get it 
-> cons: need to write lots of code {stores,actions,reducers} for simple task)

Redux internally using hooks concept i think.

Hooks Basics:
--------------
this.state = {
    name  : "pavan"
}

this.setState({name:"santosh"})
note: setState function is availabel only is class component

so, react introduced hooks in functional component
{name,setName} = useState("santosh");
setName("Santosh");





Class variable are not accessible outside class so we are trying to delcare them globally using store and accessing them using actions.


1. Store - plain json object with variables
2. Actions - plain json object with functions

To add/update the data in the store we write functions in  actions.

step-1 :  Wrap application with <Provider store={store}> Tag with store has a prop
step-2 : Wrap component with Connect(store,actions)(ComponentName)

5. create and declare actions in a seperate file and import them in a component


addTodo(data,'addusername');
addTodo(this.state,'delete');

function actions(content,type,newValue){


    
}

function addTodo (content,type){
	switch(type){
		case 'addusername':
            content.username = "pavan"l
	    break;
        case 'delete':
            delete content.username;
        break;
	}

    return content;
}
